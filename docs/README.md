# Purdue ROV ROS 2 Tutorials

This directory contains tutorials for Purdue ROV's ROS 2 software stack. The idea of this directory is to create a set of tutorials that can be used to teach new members how software is written for the ROV so our code is consistent and standardized. It is also a good reference for current members to look back on when they need to remember how a certain part of the software works.
